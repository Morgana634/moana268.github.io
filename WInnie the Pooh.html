CG5
Colors weave into a spire of flame
Distant sparks call to a past still unnamed
Bear this torch against the cold of the night
Search your soul and reawaken the undying light!
On that day when the sky fell away
Our world came to an end
In our eyes, did a fading sun rise
In the dark glimmering shadows
Silence grows in the spaces between
Stretching out beyond time
Rising up as a chorus of souls
Find a voice
Flickering through the void
These little sparks cling on to life
Everyone caught in the struggle
And then the storms of change
They fan the flames
Scattering ashes to the wind!
Every soul contains a whisper of light
Gleaming faintly as it dwindles from sight
No escape, no greater fate to be made
In the end the chains of time will not break
Colors weave into a spire of flame
Distant sparks call to a past still unnamed
Bear this torch against the cold of the night
Search your soul and reawaken the undying light!
As fate spins
A thread without end
New life draws it's first breath
Blossoming in a soil reclaimed from the past
Where destiny holds fast
Here where we stand
Hand clenched in hand
Everyone caught in the struggle
This is the day we finally find our way
Stepping into our tomorrow!
Every soul contains a whisper of light
Growing louder as it calls to unite
From the distance sings a chorus of souls
Rising slowly, stirring heat from the coals
Colors weave into a spire of flame
Distant sparks call to a past still unnamed
Bear this torch against the cold of the night
Light will guide you on your way to the ultimate fight!
Every soul contains a whisper of light
Growing louder as it calls to unite
From the distance sings a chorus of souls
Rising slowly, stirring heat from the coals
Colors weave into a spire of flame
Distant sparks call to a past still unnamed
Bear this torch against the cold of the night
Light will guide you on your way to the ultimate fight!
